# Code and Data for _A generic battery cycling optimization framework with learned sampling and early stopping strategies_

## Introduction

This folder contains the code and data for the paper _A generic battery cycling optimization framework with learned sampling and early stopping strategies_ (not published yet).

## Software environment

Following softwares are used:

* COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5
* Matlab 2020b
* Python 3.7
    * Optuna 2.6.0
    * Ax 0.2.4

Higher versions should work fine. Lower versions may be compatible.

## Folders and contained files
* **processed_data**: Processed experiment dataand generated simulation data. 
    * **exp_dict.pkl**: Experiment data file, generated by `preprocess_exp_data.py`.
    * **sim_dict.pkl**: Simulation data file, generated by `generate_sim_data.py`.
* **raw_data**: Raw experiment data. Extracted from Fig. 5 of the paper [Holistic calendar aging model parametrization concept for lifetime prediction of graphite/NMC lithium-ion cells
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X19312009). File names denote temperature, the number next to "x" denote state of charge (SOC).

* **result**: Result files generated by **main_exp.py**, **main_sim.py** and **main_sim_noprune.py** (in current root folder).

## Root files

* **preprocess_exp_data.py**: The code to preprocess raw data. You'll get **exp_dict.pkl** (which is already uploaded in [processed_data](./processed_data)).

* **generate_sim_data.py**: Generate simulation data. You'll get **sim_dict.pkl** (which is already uploaded [processed_data](./processed_data)).



* **calendar_aging_final.m**: A matlab script to generate **calendar_aging_final.mph**.

* **comsol_api.m**: A matlab script to calculate capacity, which serves as the interface bewtween python files (main_*.py) and the COMSOL file (
  calendar_aging_final.mph).

* **main_exp.py**: Run the fitting algorithm in the experiment case (Case 2).

* **main_sim.py**: Run the fitting algorithm in the simulation case (Case 1).

* **postprocess.py**: Postprocess result.

## How to run

1. Connect MATLAB with COMSOL server
2. Run **calendar_aging_final.m** by COMSOL to generate **calendar_aging_final.mph**

### Simulation case (Case 1)

1. Prepare with connet Python to MATLAB (which has connected to COMSOL server). You need to install MATLAB API for Python (see [doc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)) and then
   run `matlab.engine.shareEngine` on MATLAB. Other ways are also feasible, as long as Python can be connected to MATLAB.
2. [optional] Run **generate_sim_data.py** to generate **sim_dict.pkl**, or use the existing file.
3. Run **main_sim.py**; you can add or change arguments of the script; see the file for argument meanings.
3. Run **main_bo.py** and **main_sim_noprune.py**.
4. [optional] Run **postprocess.py**. 

### Experiment case (Case 2)

1. [optional] Run **preprocess_exp_data.py** to generate **exp_dict.pkl**, or use the existing file.
2. Prepare with connet Python to MATLAB (which has connected to COMSOL server). 
3. Run **main_exp.py**; you can add or change arguments of the script; see the file for argument meanings.
4. [optional] Run **postprocess.py**.
